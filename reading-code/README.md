# Code Reading Questions

Reading and investigating code is all about the questions you ask. Depending on what you want to learn from the code you will need to ask and answer different questions. This folder is full of tips and questions for reading code.

The files of code in this folder are a couple steps more advanced than what you are expected to understand in this module. The goal of studying them is to practice good code reading techniques and become comfortable making some sense of code you cannot completely understand.

# Commenting Code

there are many reasons to comment code. this folder will help you explore some of them.

the big tips:

- comments should explain _why_
- write your comments for someone who knows less than you
- bad/wrong comments are more unhelpful than no comments
- use variable names to describe variables

## Stale Comments

comments that did not change when the code changed

## Studying Existing Code

> see [forest-and-trees](../forest-and-trees/README.md) for more detail

Commenting new code to help yourself understand it.

this is the exception to the _why_ comment rule. but please don't fill your projects with forest/tree comments.

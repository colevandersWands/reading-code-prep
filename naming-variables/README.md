tips for naming variables.

- positive examples: simple working programs with well-named variables & comments explaining why they're good names
- negative examples: simple working programs with poorly-named variables & comments explaining why they're bad
- exercises: simple working programs with arbitrary variables names (ie. `a`, `b`,`c` used in order). students need to analyze the program (forest & trees) then give the variables better names

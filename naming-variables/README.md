# Naming Variables

Your code should be written first for humans, and then for computers. One of the best tools you have for helping humans is to use good variable names.

## Variable Analysis

The first step to coming up with a good variable name is to understand how the variable is used. This doesn't need to be a complicated task, there's a few simple questions you can ask to begin understanding the variables in a program. To answer the first three questions all you need to do is read the code.

This exercise is what's called _static analysis_. You can answer all of these questions _without_ running or tracing the code! (of course you can run it, you just don't need to)

The first things to notice are the simplest, just carefully read the code to notice these details:

- **Declaration:** Where in the source code is the variable declared? Is it initialized with a value or not? (`let x;` is not initialized. `let x = 1;` is initialized).
- **Reads:** How many times in the source code is this variable read? Careful! This is not the same as how many times it is read in the program's trace. In the example below there is only one line that writes to the `input` variable, even though you may execute that line of code many times when running the program.
- **Writes:** How many times in the source code is this variable's value changed after it was initialized? Careful! Like with reads, this should be the number of times the variable is read _in the source code_. There are only two lines that read from `input`, even if those lines are executed many times when you run the program.
- _hint: use the `?variables` lens_

Taking a closer look at each time a variable is used you can describe them further:

- **Types**: What types are assigned to this variable? Is there only one type, or does it store different types at different times?
- **Scopes**: In which scope is this variable declared? In which scopes is it used? Does it store a value that was created in a different scope?
- **Tests**: Is this variable used in control flow tests? What types of control flow? How often?

Finally you're ready for the big one ...

- **Description:** How is each variable used in the code, what's it's role? Try to write a short and simple description of why this variable needs to be in the program.

In the Naming Variables examples & exercises you will learn a structured approach to analyzing and naming your variables. The first step is to analyze the code with comments like these:

```js
/*
  input: used to store the user's input
    declaration:
      init: yes
      types: object (null)
      scopes: global
    reads: 2
      scopes: global
      tests: while
    writes: 1
      types: string, object (null)
      scopes: while
*/

// input: init, null
let input = null;
// input: read
while (input === null) {
  // input: write, string or null
  input = prompt('enter something');
}

// input: read
alert(input);
```

## Variable Roles

The JavaScript language treats variables like a blank slate, you can name them whatever you want and you can assign any value to them. But that doesn't mean all variables in a program are the same. Variables can have very different _roles_ in your program depending on how they're used.

Learning to identify these roles in code will help understand other people's code and to write your own. Your goal in this chapter is to explore the different roles a variable can play in a program and how you can come up with names that describe not only the values stored in a variable, but also how it's used in the program.

In this module you will only learn a few different roles, but there are more that you will encounter over your time as a programmer. Learning to use different roles will help you develope more cleanly and effectively. You aren't required to assign a role to each variable in these exercises, but keeping roles in mind will help to think of better names.

Can you think of any other roles whiles studying these exercises?

- **Fixed Value**: a variable that never changes after initialization
- **Stepper**: changes systematically, going through a series of values for control flow
- **Flag**: a boolean variable which can be turned "on" or "off" to control program flow
- **Gatherer**: combines a series of values into a new value
- **Holder**: stores one selected value from a series of values
- **Temporary**: holds a value for a short time, before using it somewhere else

## Naming Conventions

There are no real rules to naming variables but there are some conventions, some good and some bad practices. Each company or project may also have it's own rules. Here's some resources to get you started:

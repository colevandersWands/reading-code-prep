## Getting Started

How to study the code in this repo.

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>
<br>

> You will need [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) on your computer to study this material
>
> Using a browser with good DevTools will make your life easier: [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium), [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

1. Install or update the `study-lenses` package globally
   - `npm install -g study-lenses` (if you do not have it already)
   - `npm update -g study-lenses` (if you already have it installed)
1. Clone this repository:
   - `git clone git@github.com:HackYourFutureBelgium/reading-code.git` (SSH) (recommended)
   - `git clone https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/reading-code.git` (HTTPS)
   - `gh repo clone HackYourFutureBelgium/reading-code` (GH CLI)
1. `cd` into the repository
   - `cd reading-code`
1. Run the `study` command from your CLI
   - `study`
1. The material will open in your default browser, you're good to go!

> If you have a windows computer and get this error:
>
> - `... /study.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts ...`
>
> follow the instructions in [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63424744), that should take care of it ; )

## Study Tips

- Don't rush, understand! Programming is hard.
  - The examples and exercises will still be there to study later.
  - It's better to fail tests slowly and learn from your mistakes than to pass tests quickly and not understand why.
- Don't skip the examples! Understanding and experimenting with working code is a very effective way to learn programming.
- Practice Pair Programming: two people, one computer.
- Read the code out loud
- Take a look through the [HYF Study Tips](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/study-tips) for more inspiration

Not all assignments are created equal. These 3 emoji's will help you figure out how to spend your study time as effectively as possible.

- ü•ö `:egg:` - these assignments are required, they cover the base skills you'll need to move on.
- üê£ `:hatching_chick:` - do your best to start these exercises. you don't need to finish or master them (yet) but getting the main idea will be helpful in coming weeks
- üê• `:hatched_chick:` - Have you finished all the ü•ö's and started all the üê£'s? push yourself with these challenges!

### `study-lense` Guide

- `highlight`
- `parsons`
- `flowchart`
- `study`:
  - console
  - trace
  - selection
- `diff`

```
smartize these

  code-reading-club questions
  commenting paths
explicitly learn reading strategies, ie.
  find variable declaration and follow all changes
  find function declaration then all calls
  call-stack

### In this Repo

#### offline materials (needs a printer)

- [printables](./printables) (if you have access to a printer)
  - flashcards, diagrams, ... things to print and study on paper

## rendered markdown

- ü•ö [what-is-programming](./what-is-programming)
  - just what it sounds like
- ü•ö [code-reading-questions](./code-reading-questions)
  - based off the agendas for Code Reading Club, but decomposed into a tool-belt of questions and investigative techniques students can use to read new files of code.
  - this would be covered early on and used as a reference thereafter
- ü•ö [concept-review](./concept-review)
  - flash cards for reviewing what's covered in this
  - scoped by the learning objectives to act as a self-assessment
- ü•ö [vocabulary](./vocabulary)
  - what it sounds like, vocab flashcards
- üê£ [phrase-book](./phrase-book)
  - common JS snippets that students can use to get productive, without understanding all the bits
  - like a travel phrase book in a foreign language. no grammar, all translations of practical phrases. goes both ways

## javascript

1. ü•ö [comments](./comments)
   - a guide to the different ways comments can be used in code
   - accompanied by files of code demonstrating different (good and bad) comments
2. üê£ [forest-and-trees](./forest-and-trees)
   - a structured approach to deep reading files of code, along with a full commenting strategy
   - not something to recommend doing in real projects but maybe helpful while learning
3. üê£ [naming-variables](./naming-variables)
   - tips for writing good variable names
   - exercises would be something like replacing bad variable names with better ones in working programs\
4. üê£ [logging](./logging)
   - tips and strategies for logging code
   - in the exercises students will be given un-logged code, and need to write in helpful logs
   - leads right into debugging
5. üê£ [fill-in-blanks](./fill-in-blanks)
   - different types of exercises built around filling in blanks in .js files

## parsons

- üê£ [parsons](./parsons)
  - these can actually be run, but it's not required

## Read Only

- [read-only](./read-only)
  - files of more advanced code that students would not be expected to fully understand
  - for practicing the code reading questions and gaining experience with un-understandable code

# Phrase Book

some starting points and JS "idioms". common things you need to do while programming, translated from one language to the other.

from here a motivated student could explore [VSCode snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets)

could also be organized by concept with translations going both ways:

```
/phrase book
  /variables.md
    # e to js
    # js to e
  /loops.md
```
